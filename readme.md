### Create react app
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start

Success! Created frontend at /home/wsc-194a/workspace/OpenGameArt/opengameart/frontend
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd frontend
  npm start

Happy hacking!

Note: the project was boostrapped with an old unsupported version of tools.
Please update to Node >=6 and npm >=3 to get supported tools in new projects.
